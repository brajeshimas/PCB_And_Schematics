# 🧠 PCB & Schematics Portfolio

Welcome to my showcase of schematic diagrams and PCB layout designs created using **KiCad**.  
This repository is dedicated to demonstrating my **hands-on PCB design skills** and attention to detail in circuit development.

This all sample just created by myself, I can't show any company's property which is designed by me
